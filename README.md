# twitter_tweets_analysis_project

This CodeCademy project of the Data Science Path is two parts project. 

1. In the first part, I use a Naive Bayes Classifier to find patterns in real tweets.

More detailed specifications and outcomes can be found here: https://github.com/vshakun/twitter_tweets_analysis/blob/master/tweet_location.ipynb


2. In the second part, I use the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to predict whether a tweet will go viral.
